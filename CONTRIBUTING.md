## Developing in the Open

Developing in the open creates a healthier working environment, a more collaborative process, and just better software.

While this functions currently only as a prototype, we welcome contributions.

Contributions that include appropriate unit tests are more likely to be accepted by  the team.

## Feedback

To provide feedback on the code please create an issue on GitHub.
For other issues please contact [Andrew Davy](mailto:andrew.davy@sba.gov).

## How to Contribute

To contribute simply create a pull request:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch to work on (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your work (we like commits that explain your thought process)
4. Submit a pull request
5. If there is an issue associated with your pull request link that issue.

For documentation changes you can edit the file directly on GitHub and select the    option to create a pull request with your own branch. 

## Tests and Continuous Integration

All pull requests must pass our continuous integration (CI) tests in order to be     accepted.
